										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Chain Gang!  For only being around for just under 40 days, we have made incredible strides in such a short period of time!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>August 24th</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marked the launch of our first fully working product and proof of concept use case Super Crypto Kart for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.  We had great feedback and users really loved the concept and game with hundreds of downloads just on Day 1!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><b>August 26th</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we launched our much anticipated ILO on Uniswap and were the 3rd most traded token on the DEX beating out several stable coins and trading nearly 20M USD in volume!  Quite the feat for a new token!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Layer 1 multiplayer launched shortly thereafter amidst the DeFi craze of August and early September.  We quickly realized that with the escalating GAS fees on the Ethereum network that we needed to take action and FAST!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started working on a Layer 2 solution on the MATIC network on </span><b>September 16th</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and just </span><b>7 days later</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had a fully working version of Super Crypto Kart and ported the Chain Games network to be able to run on MATIC testnet.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day after our testnet launch on </span><b>September 24th</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we released the full version of multiplayer on Layer 2 MATIC mainnet!  We had amazing execution and commitment from our dev team and support from all members of the community to push out this full stack solution in such record time!  8 days is truly an incredible timeframe to complete such a task, especially in the crypto world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Layer 2 running optimally, we were able to reduce GAS fees to next to nothing, while significantly increasing game speed, contract execution time, and improving UX.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><b>September 27th</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we announced our intention to implement Call of Duty: Modern Warfare where users can compete on Battle Royale style matches and multiplayer battles for most points, kills, wins, and more to win $CHAIN!  In addition we are researching other Tier 1 games where we can execute this same method.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-2278 size-full" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atari-mention.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="141" />October 2nd</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marked the news of a MASSIVE strategic partnership with one of the world’s most iconic consumer brands and interactive entertainment producers, ATARI.  ATARI will be integrating the $CHAIN token into their soon to be launched ATARI Crypto-casino, and Chain Games will be implementing the ATRI token into the CHAIN ecosystem.  Furthermore, ATARI CEO Fred Chesnais has accepted an advisory role on the Chain Games board!  This partnership closely aligns both companies continued interests in blockchain, crypto and the video game industry moving forward.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><b>October 4th </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">we</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">released the much anticipated Super Crypto Kart for Android with full single player and online multiplayer modes enabled!  This enables cross-platform play across Windows, Mac OS, Linux and now Android!  iOS is next!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>October 5th </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">we announced that our Call of Duty: Modern Warfare implementation will be completed and launched towards the end of November.  Not only that, but we have also started working on adding top tier games </span><b>Fortnite, Madden 21, FIFA 21 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><b> Fall Guys</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the list of playable games to compete on in the Chain Games network!  The competition is going to get fierce, and so are the $CHAIN payouts for winners!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been a very productive 40 days Chain Gang, and we anticipate the next 40 days to be just as productive as we go full steam into releasing high profile games to play on the Chain network.  We feel these new tier 1 games will really draw in the audience we need and expect to continue down the path of blockchain gaming excellence!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until next time,</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Barlam</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are proud to announce we have collaborated &amp; integrated with Layer 2 provider <a href="https://matic.network/">MATIC network</a> to enable <em><strong>SUPER FAST</strong></em> and <em><strong>SUPER CHEAP</strong></em> Ethereum transactions for all games on the Chain Games decentralized gaming ecosystem providing a superior UX for all users!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are LIVE on mainnet right now with the <strong>MATIC</strong> solution and here at <a href="https://twitter.com/RealChainGames">@RealChainGames</a> we like to under promise and over deliver!  That’s why we are bringing you the full mainnet implementation of this solution a <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>full day early</strong></span></em> instead of our original plan of Sept 25th! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f973.png" alt="🥳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s super easy to get started to play on mainnet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How to Play on MATIC Mainnet:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong style="font-size: inherit;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Step 1:</span> You will need some $ETH for gas fees and $CHAIN tokens to play.</strong></h4>
<p><strong>BUY $CHAIN</strong> from your favorite exchange:</p>
<p><span class="s1">Uniswap &#8211; </span><a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xC4C2614E694cF534D407Ee49F8E44D125E4681c4">https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xC4C2614E694cF534D407Ee49F8E44D125E4681c4</a><span class="s1"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f984.png" alt="🦄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
</span><span class="s1">ProBit &#8211; </span><a href="https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/CHAIN-USDT">https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/CHAIN-USDT</a><span class="s1"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4b9.png" alt="💹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
</span><span class="s1">Bilaxy &#8211; </span><a href="https://bilaxy.com/trade/CHAIN_ETH">https://bilaxy.com/trade/CHAIN_ETH</a><span class="s1"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4b1.png" alt="💱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
</span>Multi.io<span class="s1"> &#8211; </span><a href="https://multi.io/en/trading/exchange/CHAINUSDT">https://multi.io/en/trading/exchange/CHAINUSDT</a><span class="s1"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="💰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Step 2:</span> Fund your gaming session &#8211; <a href="https://wallet.chaingames.io/">https://wallet.chaingames.io/</a></strong></h4>
<p>We recommend allocating quite a bit so you have enough for future gaming sessions as well and can avoid paying additional ETH gas fees. This is the longest part of the process as it will transfer the tokens from ETH Layer 1 to MATIC Layer 2. It can take up to 5 minutes to complete. We are working on an instant cross-chain function to make this process MUCH quicker, but for now, just wait patiently <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Step 3:</span> Download and install Super Crypto Kart for your desired platform:</strong></h4>
<p>Windows &#8211; <a href="https://d3op4twapqdg5r.cloudfront.net/SuperCryptoKart-v2.2.0-installer-64bit.exe">https://d3op4twapqdg5r.cloudfront.net/SuperCryptoKart-v2.2.0-installer-64bit.exe</a><br />
