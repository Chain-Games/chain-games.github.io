<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> RISKS </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Development Failure or Abortion.</strong> Acquiring and storing CHAIN for purposes of using our services involves various risks, in particular that Chain Games may not be able to launch some operations and continue developing its platform or community. Any interested person who is not in the position to accept nor to understand the risks associated with the activity, or any other risks as indicated in the Terms, should not acquire CHAIN or use our Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Legal Risk Concerning Security Regulation</strong>. There is a risk that in some jurisdictions CHAIN might be considered as a security, now or in the future. Company does not give warranties or guarantees that CHAIN are not a security in all jurisdictions. Each user of Chain Games shall bear its own legal or financial consequences of CHAIN being considered a security in their respective jurisdiction. The legal ability of Company to provide CHAIN in some jurisdictions may be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event, it turns out with a high degree of certainty that CHAIN are not legal in certain jurisdiction, Company will base on its sole discretion either (a) cease operations in that jurisdiction, or (b) adjust CHAIN in a way to comply with the regulation should that be possible and viable. It is your obligation to check if acquisition and disposal of CHAIN is legal in your jurisdiction, and by accepting these Terms you expressly agree and warrant that you will not use Chain Games should the use not be legal in the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Malfunction of Blockchain</strong>. Nobody can guarantee the Ethereum source code used by Company will be flaw-free. It may contain certain flaws, errors, defects and bugs, which may disable some functionality for users, expose users’ information or otherwise. Such flaw would compromise the usability and/or security of Company and consequently bring adverse impact on the value of Company. Open-source codes rely on transparency to promote community-sourced identification and solution of problems within the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update of the Source Code</strong>. The Ethereum source code could be updated, amended, altered or modified from time to time by the developers and/or the community of Ethereum. Nobody is able to foresee or guarantee the precise result of such update, amendment, alteration or modification. As a result, any update, amendment, alteration or modification could lead to an unexpected or unintended outcome that adversely affects CHAIN and/or Company operation or market value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Internet Transmission Risks</strong>. You acknowledge that there are risks associated with utilizing Internet-based digital assets, products and website including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections. You acknowledge that the Company shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using our services, website, platform, CHAIN howsoever caused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cryptography Risks.</strong> You acknowledge that there are risks associated with cryptography, such as code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to all crypto-currencies including CHAIN. This could result in the theft, loss, disappearance, destruction or devaluation of Chain Games. To a reasonable extent, Company will be prepared to take proactive or remedial steps to update the protocol underlying Company in response to any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional reasonable security measures where appropriate. It is impossible to predict the future of cryptography or the future of security innovations to an extent that would permit the Company to accurately guide the development of Company to take into account such unforeseeable changes in the domains of cryptography or security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Splitting and Forking</strong>. Ethereum is an open source project and supported by the community. The developers of the Company do not lead the development, marketing, operation or otherwise of Ethereum. Anybody may develop a patch or upgrade of the source code of Ethereum’s source without prior authorization of anyone else. The acceptance of Ethereum patches or upgrades by a significant, but not overwhelming, percentage of the users could result in a “split” or “fork” in the blockchain of Ethereum, and consequently the operation of two separate networks and will remain separate until the split or forked blockchains are merged. The temporary or permanent existence of split or forked blockchains could adversely impact the operation and the market value of Chain Games and in the worst-case scenario, could ruin the sustainability of the Company. While such a split or fork in the blockchain of Ethereum would possibly be resolved by community-led efforts to merge the split or forked blockchains, the success is not guaranteed and could take long period of time to achieve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions.</strong> Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. Chain Games could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of CHAIN, which could impede or limit their existence, permissibility of their use and possession, and their value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Theft and Hacking.</strong> Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with your third-party wallet, the Website or the availability of CHAIN in any number of ways, including without limitation denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Mining Attacks</strong>. Ethereum blockchain, which is used for the CHAIN, is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Mining Attacks, as described above, may also target other blockchain networks, with which Chain Games interacts with. Any successful attacks present a risk to the CHAIN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Loss of Value and Uninsured Losses</strong>. Value of CHAIN may fluctuate and you may suffer loss in value of such acquired CHAIN. In addition to loss of value risk, CHAIN are entirely uninsured and are unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unanticipated Risks</strong>. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are new and untested technology and in addition to the risks outlined in these Terms, there are also unforeseeable risks that may materialize as unanticipated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You acknowledge, agree and warrant that you have been warned of the potential risks involved by using our services, website and product and other relevant technologies mentioned herein as well as that there may be other risks involved, which are not specified herein and that you fully accept such risks.</p>
